# |IT-145|

# Summarize the project and what problem was it solving:
For this project I had to create a program as a rescue animal management system, implemented through Java classes such as RescueAnimal, Dog, and Monkey, and a driver class Driver to interact with the system through a command-line interface. 
The system allows users to intake new dogs and monkeys, reserve animals, and print lists of all animals or available animals.


# What did you do particularly well?
The project effectively models rescue animals and their attributes using object-oriented principles.
The command-line interface provides clear menu options for users to interact with the system.
Getter and setter methods are implemented for encapsulation, ensuring controlled access to the attributes of each animal.


# Where could you enhance your code? How could these improvements make your code more efficent, secure, etc?
Data validation could be strengthened to ensure that user input meets expected formats and ranges, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the system.
Consistency in naming conventions and formatting could be improved to make the code more uniform and readable.
Consideration of exception handling to gracefully manage errors and unexpected situations would enhance the resilience of the program.


# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? 
It was challanging Implementing user input validation and error handling, especially in scenarios where unexpected input could lead to program errors.
Ensuring consistency and uniformity in naming conventions and formatting throughout the codebase.


# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Object-oriented design principles and implementation, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
User interface design and interaction through a command-line interface.
Data validation and error handling techniques.
Documentation and code commenting to improve readability and maintainability.


# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I structured my code logically, with clear separation of concerns between different classes and methods, making it easier to maintain and understand.
Meaningful method and variable names, along with comments and documentation, enhance readability and provide context for understanding my code's purpose and functionality.
My code can be adapted to accommodate new features or changes in requirements through modular design and encapsulation, minimizing the impact of modifications on other parts of the system.
